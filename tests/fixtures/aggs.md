### Custom Bars (OHLC)

**Endpoint:** `GET /v2/aggs/ticker/{stocksTicker}/range/{multiplier}/{timespan}/{from}/{to}`

**Description:**

Retrieve aggregated historical OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) and volume data for a specified stock ticker over a custom date range and time interval in Eastern Time (ET). Aggregates are constructed exclusively from qualifying trades that meet specific conditions. If no eligible trades occur within a given timeframe, no aggregate bar is produced, resulting in an empty interval that indicates a lack of trading activity during that period. Users can tailor their data by adjusting the multiplier and timespan parameters (e.g., a 5-minute bar), covering pre-market, regular market, and after-hours sessions. This flexibility supports a broad range of analytical and visualization needs.

Use Cases: Data visualization, technical analysis, backtesting strategies, market research.

## Query Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `stocksTicker` | string | Yes | Specify a case-sensitive ticker symbol. For example, AAPL represents Apple Inc. |
| `multiplier` | integer | Yes | The size of the timespan multiplier. |
| `timespan` | string | Yes | The size of the time window. |
| `from` | string | Yes | The start of the aggregate time window. Either a date with the format YYYY-MM-DD or a millisecond timestamp. |
| `to` | string | Yes | The end of the aggregate time window. Either a date with the format YYYY-MM-DD or a millisecond timestamp. |
| `adjusted` | boolean | No | Whether or not the results are adjusted for splits.  By default, results are adjusted. Set this to false to get results that are NOT adjusted for splits.  |

| `limit` | integer | No | Limits the number of base aggregates queried to create the aggregate results. Max 50000 and Default 5000.
